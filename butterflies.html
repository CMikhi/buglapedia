                    <strong>Butterflies</strong> are insects in the macrolepidopteran clade <em>Rhopalocera</em> from the order <em>Lepidoptera</em>, which also includes moths. Adult butterflies have large, often brightly colored wings, and conspicuous, fluttering flight. The group comprises the large superfamily <em>Papilionoidea</em>, which contains at least one former group, the skippers, and the most recent analyses suggest it also contains the moth-butterflies.

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        Butterflies are found worldwide except in Antarctica, with the greatest diversity in tropical regions. There are approximately 17,500 known species of butterflies, divided into six families. They are distinguished from moths by their clubbed antennae, their tendency to fold their wings vertically over their backs, and their generally diurnal (day-flying) habits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Butterflies have fascinated humans for millennia and appear in art, literature, and cultural symbolism across civilizations. They are often associated with transformation, beauty, and the soul due to their remarkable metamorphosis from caterpillar to winged adult.

                    <h2>Anatomy</h2>
                    <p>
                        Butterfly wings are covered in thousands of tiny overlapping scales, which give them their colors and patterns. These scales are modified hairs and are responsible for both pigmented and structural coloration. The iridescent blues and greens seen in many species result from microscopic structures that interfere with light.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Adult butterflies have a long, coiled proboscis used for drinking nectar and other liquids. They cannot bite or chew – their mouthparts are designed solely for sipping. Butterflies taste with their feet, which have chemoreceptors that help them identify host plants for laying eggs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Butterfly sizes range from the tiny Western Pygmy Blue (12 mm wingspan) to the Queen Alexandra's Birdwing (up to 31 cm wingspan), the largest butterfly in the world.

                    <h2>Life Cycle and Metamorphosis</h2>
                    <p>
                        Butterflies undergo complete metamorphosis, one of nature's most remarkable transformations:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Egg</strong> – tiny, often ornate eggs laid on specific host plants</li>
                        <li><strong>Larva (Caterpillar)</strong> – the feeding stage, focused on growth</li>
                        <li><strong>Pupa (Chrysalis)</strong> – the transformation stage enclosed in a protective case</li>
                        <li><strong>Adult (Imago)</strong> – the reproductive winged stage</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        During pupation, the caterpillar's body completely breaks down and reorganizes into the adult butterfly form. This process typically takes 10-14 days but varies by species and environmental conditions. Some species overwinter as pupae.

                    <h2>Types of Butterflies</h2>
                    <h3>Swallowtails (Papilionidae)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Large, colorful butterflies often with distinctive tail-like extensions on their hindwings. Includes the iconic Tiger Swallowtail and the rare Queen Alexandra's Birdwing.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Brush-footed Butterflies (Nymphalidae)</h3>
                    <p>
                        The largest butterfly family, including Monarchs, Painted Ladies, and Admirals. Named for their reduced, brush-like forelegs.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Whites and Sulphurs (Pieridae)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Medium-sized butterflies typically white, yellow, or orange. The Cabbage White is one of the most widespread butterflies globally.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Blues, Coppers, and Hairstreaks (Lycaenidae)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Small butterflies, often with metallic or iridescent coloring. Many have fascinating symbiotic relationships with ants.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Monarchs (Danaus plexippus)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Famous for their incredible annual migration of up to 3,000 miles between Canada/USA and Mexico. Their orange and black pattern warns predators of their toxicity from milkweed consumption.

                    <h2>Behavior</h2>
                    <p>
                        Butterflies exhibit fascinating behaviors:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Migration</strong> – some species travel thousands of miles seasonally</li>
                        <li><strong>Puddling</strong> – gathering at mud puddles to obtain minerals and salts</li>
                        <li><strong>Basking</strong> – spreading wings to absorb sunlight for thermoregulation</li>
                        <li><strong>Hilltopping</strong> – males gathering at hilltops to find mates</li>
                        <li><strong>Mimicry</strong> – resembling toxic species for protection</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Butterflies communicate through visual displays, pheromones, and even sound. Their wing patterns serve for camouflage, warning coloration, and mate attraction.

                <section id="conservation">
                    <h2>Conservation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Many butterfly species face significant threats:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Habitat loss</strong> – destruction of meadows, forests, and wetlands</li>
                        <li><strong>Climate change</strong> – altering migration patterns and plant availability</li>
                        <li><strong>Pesticide use</strong> – affecting both butterflies and their host plants</li>
                        <li><strong>Invasive species</strong> – outcompeting native plants and predators</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The Monarch butterfly population has declined by over 80% in recent decades. Conservation efforts include creating butterfly gardens, protecting migration corridors, and reducing pesticide use. Planting native milkweed and nectar plants helps support local butterfly populations.

                <strong>Dragonflies</strong> are flying insects belonging to the order <em>Odonata</em>, suborder <em>Anisoptera</em>. They are characterized by large, multifaceted eyes, two pairs of strong, transparent wings, and an elongated body. Dragonflies are among the fastest flying insects in the world and are ancient creatures that have existed for over 300 million years.

            <div class="section" id="overview">
                <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Dragonflies are found on every continent except Antarctica, with the greatest diversity in tropical regions. There are approximately 3,000 known species of dragonflies worldwide. They are closely related to damselflies, which together form the order Odonata, but dragonflies are generally larger and hold their wings horizontally when at rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These ancient insects are living fossils – their ancestors, the giant griffinflies, had wingspans of up to 75 cm (30 inches) and lived during the Carboniferous period. Modern dragonflies retain many features of their prehistoric relatives and are considered among the most successful predators in the insect world.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section" id="anatomy">
                <h2 class="section-title">Anatomy</h2>
                <p>
                    Dragonflies possess remarkable anatomical features that make them exceptional hunters. Their compound eyes contain up to 30,000 individual facets (ommatidia), giving them nearly 360-degree vision. They can see a wider spectrum of colors than humans, including ultraviolet light.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their four wings operate independently, allowing for incredible aerial maneuverability. Dragonflies can fly forward at speeds up to 35 mph (56 km/h), hover in place, fly backward, and even upside down. Their wing muscles attach directly to the wings rather than the thorax, enabling precise control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dragonfly sizes range from the small Scarlet Dwarf (20 mm wingspan) to the Giant Petaltail (160 mm wingspan). Their long, slender abdomen helps with balance during flight and contains the reproductive organs.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section" id="lifecycle">
                <h2 class="section-title">Life Cycle</h2>
                <p>Dragonflies undergo incomplete metamorphosis with three life stages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Egg</strong> – laid in or near water, sometimes inside aquatic plants</li>
                    <li><strong>Nymph (Naiad)</strong> – an aquatic stage that can last 1-5 years</li>
                    <li><strong>Adult</strong> – the terrestrial flying stage, typically lasting a few weeks to months</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Dragonfly nymphs are voracious aquatic predators, using a unique extendable jaw (labium) to capture prey including mosquito larvae, tadpoles, and even small fish. The transformation to adult form is dramatic – the nymph climbs out of the water, and the adult dragonfly emerges from its exoskeleton.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section" id="types">
                <h2 class="section-title">Types of Dragonflies</h2>
                <h3>Skimmers (Libellulidae)</h3>
                <p>
                    The largest dragonfly family, including common species like the Blue Dasher and Widow Skimmer. They are often brightly colored and frequently seen perching on vegetation near water.
                </p>
                <h3>Darners (Aeshnidae)</h3>
                <p>
                    Large, powerful fliers including the Common Green Darner. They are known for their long-distance migrations and can be seen hunting far from water.
                </p>
                <h3>Clubtails (Gomphidae)</h3>
                <p>
                    Named for the club-shaped tip of their abdomen. They prefer rivers and streams with sandy or muddy bottoms and often perch on the ground.
                </p>
                <h3>Cruisers (Macromiidae)</h3>
                <p>
                    Strong, fast fliers that patrol along rivers and lake shores. They rarely perch and are often seen cruising back and forth over water.
                </p>
                <h3>Emeralds (Corduliidae)</h3>
                <p>
                    Named for their brilliant green eyes. They are typically found near bogs, marshes, and slow-moving streams in forested areas.
                </p>

            <div class="section" id="behavior">
                <h2 class="section-title">Behavior and Hunting</h2>
                <p>Dragonflies are apex aerial predators with remarkable hunting abilities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hunting success rate</strong> – up to 95%, the highest of any predator</li>
                    <li><strong>Interception hunting</strong> – they predict prey trajectory rather than chasing</li>
                    <li><strong>Territorial behavior</strong> – males aggressively defend breeding territories</li>
                    <li><strong>Migration</strong> – some species travel thousands of miles across oceans</li>
                    <li><strong>Thermoregulation</strong> – basking and obelisking to control body temperature</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Dragonflies catch prey mid-flight using their spiny legs to form a basket. They consume mosquitoes, gnats, flies, and other small insects, eating up to hundreds of mosquitoes per day.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section" id="ecology">
                <h2 class="section-title">Ecological Importance</h2>
                <p>Dragonflies serve as important indicators and contributors to ecosystem health:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Water quality indicators</strong> – their presence indicates clean, healthy aquatic ecosystems</li>
                    <li><strong>Pest control</strong> – consume vast quantities of mosquitoes and other pest insects</li>
                    <li><strong>Food source</strong> – prey for birds, fish, frogs, and spiders</li>
                    <li><strong>Biodiversity</strong> – contribute to the food web in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Climate change and habitat loss threaten dragonfly populations worldwide. Wetland conservation is crucial for protecting these beneficial insects and the ecosystems they inhabit.
                </p>
